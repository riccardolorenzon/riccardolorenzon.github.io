      <description>My first post on this blog is dedicated to the blog itself, and more precisely to the technology that i used to get it up and running.
First, i worked with a few CMS tools in the past, mostly for friends that wanted a quick page on the internet for their wedding, birthdays, etc etc. I remember how easy it was to set up a Wordpress website and make it beautiful by buying a 15$ template.</description>
