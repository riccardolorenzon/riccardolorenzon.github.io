      <description>For several projects i&amp;rsquo;m currently working on, a AWS Solution Architect associate certification is required.
I don&amp;rsquo;t actually believe in certifications as a way to prove any kind of knowledge, i found them useful to have an overview of how a certain product or service works and which kind of problems it&amp;rsquo;s meant to solve.
Having worked with AWS for more than 5 years i can say that i got my hands dirty with most of the topics involved.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since my last post on this blog. I travelled a lot in the begin of this year, and i consider myself like to have done it before the global spread of the Covid-19.
I&amp;rsquo;m now working from home everyday, this saves me some time on the commute, that i can spend on reading and learning some new stuff. In this context i decided to create a chat application using React and Flask, mostly to try out new features of React 16.</description>

      <description>My first post on this blog is dedicated to the blog itself, and more precisely to the technology that i used to get it up and running.
First, i worked with a few CMS tools in the past, mostly for friends that wanted a quick page on the internet for their wedding, birthdays, etc etc. I remember how easy it was to set up a Wordpress website and make it beautiful by buying a 15$ template.</description>
